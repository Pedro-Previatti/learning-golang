Write a program that creates two custom struct types 
called 'triangle' and 'square'.

The 'square' type should be a struct with a field called
'sideLength' of type float64.

The 'triangle' type should be a struct with a field called
'height' of type float64 and a type called 'base' of type
float64.

Both types should have a function called 'getArea' that
returns the calculated area of the square and the triangle
  Area of triangle = 0.5 * base * height
  Area of square = sideLength * sideLength

Add a 'shape' interface that defines a function called
'printArea'. This function should calculate the area of
a given shape and print out to the terminal. Design the
interface so that the 'printArea' function can be called
with either a triangle or a square.
