Create a program that reads the contents of a text file 
and then prints your content on the terminal.

The file to be opened must be supplied as an argument to
the program when it is run in the terminal. For example,
'go run main.go myfile.txt should open create the file 
myfile.txt

To read the arguments given to a program, you can reference
the variable 'os.Args', which is a slice of type string

To open a file, check the 'Open' function documentation in 
the package 'os' - https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Open

What interfaces does 'File Type' implement?

If the 'file type implements the Reader interface', you
can reuse this io.Copy function!
